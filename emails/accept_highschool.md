Dear ${student_name},

I am pleased to inform you that you have been admitted to the Honors College at Eastern Michigan University.

Congratulations on a fine academic record. You have clearly put your time to good use, balancing academic studies with your co-curricular activities and community service. I am sure that you have the skills necessary to continue your success as you work toward your degree.

You will be receiving information regarding Honors Orientation scheduled for **_August 8th, 2015_**. At orientation, you will get a full introduction to the Honors College as well as a change to meet some of your classmates. However, prior to the orientation, you will want to access the Honors College website at [http://www.emich.edu/honors](http://www.emich.edu/honors). Once there, you will find more information about the College, and also what you can expect as a member of the Honors College. Our Honors College handbook also outlines your responsibilities and the opportunities available to you, and details all Honors College policies and procedures. Since you are responsible for knowing its contents, you may want to read the contents before you start with us next fall.

Let me know if there is anything you need from us. Meanwhile, please accept my warmest congratulations and best wishes for continued academic and personal success!
