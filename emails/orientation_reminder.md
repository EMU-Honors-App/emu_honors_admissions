Dear ${student_name},

Congratulations! You have been accepted in The Honors College at Eastern Michigan University!

This is just a reminder that in order to complete your membership with our College, you must complete an Honors Orientation. Our Honors Orientations are offered in group sessions, and you just need to attend one session. At orientation, we go over details such as the benefits of being a member the Honors College, how you can graduate with Honors, as well as our program's requirements.

If you are not able to attend a group orientation, you can also setup an individual orientation with our office through AppointmentPlus, however, we strongly encourage you to attend a group session so you can meet your fellow incoming Honors students. If you are not able to attend one of the sessions, and you are not able to schedule an Orientation with the listed availability on AppointmentPlus, please email [emuhonors@emich.edu](mailto:emuhonors@emich.edu)so we can make an appointment that works to your schedule.

To sign-up for a group Orientation session, you first must create an account with our advising scheduling system, AppointmentPlus, and then you will be able to register
for the session. We have created a list of instructions to do so below:

To schedule a group orientation appointment:

Step One: Create an account with AppointmentPlus (if you already have an account skip ahead to Step Two)

To create an account:
##
# Go to emich.edu/honors
# Select the advisors tab
# Click on the purple button labeled "Schedule your Appointment NOW"
# Select "create an account"
# Fill out required fields & select create an account
##


Step Two: Making an appointment


##
# Log in with your account and look to the left hand side.
# Under workshop registration look for one of the three Orientation workshops.
# Select the one that best fits your schedule
# Choose either to receive text reminders, or to not receive them
# Select "Finalize Appointment"
##
Once again, congratulations on your acceptance into the Honors College, and we look forward to seeing you soon!
