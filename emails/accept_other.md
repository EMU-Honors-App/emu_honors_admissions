Dear ${student_name},

Congratulations! You have been accepted in the Eastern Michigan University Honors College! After reviewing your application, we are confident that we can provide you a great educational experience while at EMU, and look forward to working with you, and helping you achieve your academic goals.

Please schedule yourself for an Orientation as soon as possible with our office so we can finalize your admission into our program. To do so, you will need to create an AppointmentPlus account, and then sign-up for an Orientation. Please follow these steps to do so:

To schedule a group orientation appointment:

Step One: Create an account with AppointmentPlus (if you already have an account skip ahead to Step Two)

To create an account:
##
# Go to emich.edu/honors
# Select the advisors tab
# Click on the purple button labeled "Schedule your Appointment NOW"
# Select "create an account"
# Fill out required fields & select create an account
##


Step Two: Making an appointment


##
# Log in with your account and look to the left hand side.
# Under workshop registration look for available orientation workshops.
# Select the one that best fits your schedule
# Choose either to receive text reminders, or to not receive text reminders
# Select "Finalize Appointment"
##
If there is not an available group session, or one that works for your schedule, you can make an individual orientation appointment with our staff as well. However,
we highly encourage the group sessions when available.

Once again, congratulations on your acceptance, and we look forward to seeing you soon!
